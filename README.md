# Ayuwoki Detector
Here in Latin America, we have (or had) a meme called _ayuwoki_. Like most memes, it's just mindless humor, but I wanted to mix it up with #DeepLearning, so I programmed an Ayuwoki Detector, using some **Computer Vision** and a **Convolutional Neural Network**. It takes an image and detects whether or not there's an Ayuwoki in it and encloses it in a rectangle. It's a totally useless application, but it was fun to work on it and the same principles could be applied for higher purposes.

This is an excercise for using Deep Learning and Computer Vision for a completely useless thing, but the same principles can definitively be used for higher purposes. Checkout the `ayuwoki-detector.ipynb` notebook for more details.
